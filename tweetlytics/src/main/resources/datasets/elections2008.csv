Obama did a good job of relating the issues together instead of just focusing on one thing at a time #debate08;positive
#current not sure who 'won' but Obama obviously came off as the more personable of the two. Still voting Obama :);positive
All in all- good debate! Candidates were fairly intelligent and mostly respectful. Didn't change my opinion, but glad I watched. #current;positive
The real winner tonight was Jim Lehrer.  You can't say PBS people don't have balls. #debate08;positive
Based on this, either candidate should be good. Impressed by both candidates. #debate08;positive

McCain looked the most presidential, that's for sure.  #debate08;positive
@MandianaJones - yes it was very obvious.;positive
