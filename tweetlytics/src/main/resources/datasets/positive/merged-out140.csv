McCain +3 for admitting that the US engaged in torture! #tweetdebate	positive

CNN played Kissinger's response proving McCains answer correct. #debate08	positive

@lindagoin To be honest, I've never had much passion for Obama. I just can't stand McCain anymore.  Obama's been growing on me though lately	positive
@janoss - So, IMO, Obama won in his eye-to-eye, direct points, and his mission. The differences were very clear tonight.	positive
#current  Why the obsessions on both right and left with who won? Both candidates clarified their positions--the viewers were the winners.	positive
