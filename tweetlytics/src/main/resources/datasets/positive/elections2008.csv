#current not sure who 'won' but Obama obviously came off as the more personable of the two. Still voting Obama :)	positive
All in all- good debate! Candidates were fairly intelligent and mostly respectful. Didn't change my opinion, but glad I watched. #current	positive

#debate08 I love watching comments roll in on Twitter's Election2008!	positive
@lindagoin To be honest, I've never had much passion for Obama. I just can't stand McCain anymore.  Obama's been growing on me though lately	positive
@janoss - So, IMO, Obama won in his eye-to-eye, direct points, and his mission. The differences were very clear tonight.	positive
#current  Why the obsessions on both right and left with who won? Both candidates clarified their positions--the viewers were the winners.	positive
"""For what it's worth, McCain is kicking Obama's ass on the Drudge poll."" #debate08"	positive
John McCain: McCain Is Right http://polfeeds.com/item/McCain-Is-Right #debate08 #current #tweetdebate	positive
@matttbastard I wish I could stay up late enough to catch Rachel's whole hour. but I need sleep. last night was kind of epic.	positive
FactCheck.org: I'd love to see you live tweet fact checks for the next debate. That would be *hot*. #current #debate08	positive
@drunnells agreed!	positive
@current This was the most intense political debate I've had since I worked in politics & lived in DC Can't wait for next one!	positive
#debate08 Obama FTW.	positive
@drunnells agreed!  #debate08	positive
@davidweiner Good question.  They both had some good lines, but McCain probably was more colorful.	positive
#debate08 @drunnells agreed!	positive
Obama said McCain was right on several issues! #debate08	positive
#debate08 Mccain mostly had his advantage by violating Lehrer's moderating.That he tied/slightly won on his strongest suit is encouraging	positive
"vermontgmg: Amazing how the ""IND"" dial line on CNN drops whenever McCain starts talking. #debate08 http://tinyurl.com/3fq2qy"	positive
Nice, Obama's Tweet machine has it goin ON after the debates. #debate08	positive
Barack Obama won this debate #tweetdebate	positive
#debate08 Great coverage on CNN measuring audience responses in real-time.	positive
"Biden on MSNBC: ""A good night for our team."" #debate08"	positive
McCain was silent while Obama talked.  Obama kept on trying to get a word in during McCain's answers.  That bothered me a lot. #debate08	positive
#debate08 the CW (Halperin) says Obama A- McCain B-, sounds about right http://tinyurl.com/4q7f8d	positive
#debate08 @Autumm right, only his statement was rebutted by his own clip of agreeing with Obama	positive
@etherkiller i don't know, i'm a huge probama, but i think mccain did well, i wanted obama to do better	positive
#debate08 - man Biden is GOOD (MSNBC).	positive
@korym Good night!	positive
#current - Wow!  Obama does his homework!  The most impressive thing tonight - HE HAD HIS OWN BRACELET!  So there!  Let the droolfest begin!	positive
@Imarilove I don't trust someone who won't meet my gaze.  I liked the fact that Obama looked directly at the camera(toward people watching)	positive
#debate08 Biden is on fire on MSNBC. Really nailing it.	positive
#debate08 interesting debate, I thought Obama held his own pretty well for what was considered McCains home turf	positive
HUGE thanks to the @twitter team for partnering on this. we can't wait to do it again next week. #current	positive
#debate08 @kcrusher Nuclear all the way. We need to explore that territory more.	positive

"Bloggers right; mccain won because it is his issue. #debate08"	positive
Face to Face with George Hussein Obama, Barack Obamaâ€™s brother http://tinyurl.com/4ckd5j <-- was this brought up in #debate08 ?	positive
Anyone trying to say John McCain is a liar, suffers misanthropy. John McCain likes anyone that likes him first. It's how he rolls! #debate08	positive
CNN post debate polling is saying the debate went to Obama with over a 10 point lead #debate08 #current	positive
@RobTornoe Lisa, of course.  #debate08	positive
Very big Obama lead in the CNN post debate poll. Interesting. #debate08	positive
