@janoss - re: emotive - neither candidate has it, but I met Obama in Chicago...so I'm biased. Obama likes to meet eye-to-eye.	positive
CNN played Kissinger's response proving McCains answer correct. #debate08	positive

@lindagoin To be honest, I've never had much passion for Obama. I just can't stand McCain anymore.  Obama's been growing on me though lately	positive
@janoss - So, IMO, Obama won in his eye-to-eye, direct points, and his mission. The differences were very clear tonight.	positive
#current  Why the obsessions on both right and left with who won? Both candidates clarified their positions--the viewers were the winners.	positive
